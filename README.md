Front-end Development

In this project, I learned how to create web pages using html and css.
Here, I created:

1. W3Schools's demo site's nostyle, style1, and style2 web pages that
   contains the same body but different css (as well as its absence).
2. index.html and deployed it with Netlify.
   The deployed site's address: https://serene-mermaid-38d138.netlify.app/
3. form.html as a nerdy survey and
4. example.html which contains a cover page from Bootstrap v.4.6.
